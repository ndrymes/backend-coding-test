# Xendit Test

The task is to build a RESTful API to create ride details and also fetch ride data from an in memory database.

# Get Started

- Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/ndrymes/backend-coding-test
- Run `npm i` or `npm install` to install all app dependencies
- Make a copy of the sample.env file and rename to .env
- Start the app using
  - `npm run dev` for development
  - `npm run start` for production

# Demo

The app is hosted on heroku. The base url is <a href="https://immense-stream-85373.herokuapp.com/">https://immense-stream-85373.herokuapp.com/</a>.
The default endpoint is an health check endpoint that returns a success response.

## API

There are multiple endpoints that can be used to retrieve records. Please find below a POSTMAN documentation url is <a href="https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7667873/U16nL4dw">https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/7667873/U16nL4dw</a>.

# Project Structure
![file structure](https://i.ibb.co/KVyzY5C/structure.png)

# Libraries Used

- Mocha - For running unit tests
- Express - Popular framework with a robust set of features for running apps
- sqlite3 - ODM for MySQl that makes maning the database much easier


# Todo

I had a lot of fun building this but there are some improvements I can still make:

- More tests, especially integration tests, unit tests for the services and api tests using super test.
- Use a DTO object to handle transfer of data from the api routes to the service layer, this will help keep data consistent even data names change
- Add a dependency injection library like awilix to handle injection of dependencies
- Include a makefile to ease the execution of some common tasks
- Role based authorization

# Testing

- To run the tests, simply type `npm test`
- We can also get code coverage by `npm run coverage`
- We can load test by running `npm run test:load`

Thank you üëç
